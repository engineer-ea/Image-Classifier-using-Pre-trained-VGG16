# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

I trained an efficient and accurate model with an accuracy of 82% in just 5 epochs using a pre-trained VGG-16 and successfully completed this project.
