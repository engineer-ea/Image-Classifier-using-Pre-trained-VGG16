# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

Successfully executed a project focusing on enhancing image classification through the implementation of transfer learning techniques. Utilized a pre-trained VGG-16 model to efficiently train a high-performing model that achieved an impressive accuracy of 82% within a remarkably short span of 5 epochs. This project demonstrated the ability to leverage established pre-trained models to rapidly achieve robust results. For this endeavor, worked with the dataset available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html, effectively curating and preparing the data for training. This accomplishment underscores proficiency in both deep learning methodologies and the practical application of pre-trained models to tackle real-world challenges in image classification.
